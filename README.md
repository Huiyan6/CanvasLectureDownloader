# CanvasLectureDownloader
This is a powershell script to download canvas lectures automatically!! If your a lazy student who doesnt download lectures as soon as they come out and have piles of lectures to download then this is for you!

This is NOT a fully fleshed out script, you will likely have to CHANGE the script yourself for your own use, but it is very straight forward just follow the comments.
This was built as a personal project, and I thought I should add more to my github so I'm just gonna post everything I make here now, so this is NOT built for user experience.
This is likely NOT helpful whatsoever lmaoooo
